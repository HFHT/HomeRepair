    The home repair program ensures our neighbors live in safe, decent homes and restores dignity and hope to the
    community. If selected you will work side-by-side with our staff and volunteers. Accommodations are made for those
    unable to physically work.
</p>
<p>
    We accept applicants whose homes need repair â€” individuals, seniors, people with disabilities, U.S. veterans,
    multi-generational households and single-parent families. Habitat is an equal housing opportunity provider.
</p>
<p>
    You are expected to volunteer and repay a portion of cost of materials based on a sliding scale and ability.
